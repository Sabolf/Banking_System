Reflections
-----------------------------
Doing this allowed me to actually put the ideas I have learned to the test. For example,
dealing with Base classes and derived classes. This project made me actually have to think
on how I am going to implement these things. It is different reading or learning about it. Doing it
is the best way to get your head around it. It was definitely difficult. It took a lot of trial and
error to see what worked and what did not. I even found myself realizing I could remove a bunch
of code and just use a function to rerun the same code as needed. This project that I have made
uses GitHub (which I still don't fully understand so the code is in a text file for now), I have
created a outline that goes through all the basic functions and goals of the program, a working 
coding model (a beta model displaying all the ideas in working and functional manner), I have 
extensively commented and described each step of the code in great detail, and there are operator 
overloaders and advanced functions placed in the structure of the code.
